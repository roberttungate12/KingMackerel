<p><strong>King mackerel</strong> (<em>Scomberomorus cavalla</em>) is a migratory marine fish with two
contemporary stocks in the southern Atlantic and northern Gulf of Mexico (According to 2020 stock assessment), but
individuals move between oceanic bodies between seasons to reproduce potentially causing issues with stock mixing. 
Without definitive population information stock management can be problematic.

<p>The goals of this project are to automate (to some degree) the inputs and outputs of 
commands using an Arelquin output file within both <code>Bash</code> and <code>R</code>. No statistical analyses will be included, but outputs
will be automated to folders, and to successfully go from the initial Arelquin output file to a summary file and 2 data visuals.
